## 👋 Hi there
This organization contains repositories owned by myself (adbo) during my studies (BSc and hopefully MSc) at the IT University of Copenhagen. 👨‍🎓

## 🗃️ More repositories
Naturally, I have not created the repository for each and every group I've been in, so the repository list is incomplete. The following is a (nonexhaustive) list of repositories owned by my groups but not by my Github profile. Some repositories are locked behind ITU's enterprise Github - I will mark those with a 🔐.
