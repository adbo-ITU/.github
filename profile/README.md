## 👋 Hi there
This organization contains repositories owned by myself (adbo) during my studies (BSc and hopefully MSc) at the IT University of Copenhagen. 👨‍🎓

## 🗃️ More repositories
Naturally, I have not created the repository for each and every group I've been in, so the repository list is incomplete. The following is a list of repositories owned by my groups but not by my Github profile.
